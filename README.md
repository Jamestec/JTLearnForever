# JTLearnForever
Bannerlord mod; (customisable) minimum learning rate for skills.

I don't think I'll be uploading this to Nexusmods since I may be accused of stealing mod ideas (JTReplaceWalls flash backs).
Not sure why I didn't check Nexus if there was already a mod that did this, but this mod is a nice introduction to Harmony for me.

Put customisable in brackets since it's not that customisable (not per skill or anything), you can set the minimum learning rate with MCM3.
